pytrebuchet documentation
=========================

**pytrebuchet** is a Python package for simulating trebuchet mechanics using physics-based
differential equations. It models the complete launch sequence from initial arm position
through projectile release and ballistic flight, supporting both hinged counterweight
and whipper-style trebuchet designs.

The package employs Lagrangian mechanics to derive the equations of motion and uses
numerical integration to predict projectile trajectories, release velocities, and
throwing distances. With support for customizable parameters including arm dimensions,
counterweight mass, sling lengths, projectile properties, and environmental conditions,
*pytrebuchet* enables detailed analysis and optimization of trebuchet performance.
